THORIN extension copyright (C) 2017 Ondřej Chrenko

THORIN is built on top of the original 2D FARGO hydrocode
(http://fargo.in2p3.fr/-Legacy-archive-),
several routines adopt the algorithms of the FARGO-ADSG version
(http://fargo.in2p3.fr/-FARGO-ADSG-)
and the code is interfaced with the REBOUND integrator package
(http://rebound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
